      <p>I've been in the customer service and support industry for almost 8 years now.
      </p>
      <p>I started as a call centre agent providing technical support for a Telco company in Australia and then got promoted as a Local IT specialist after a year. I worked there for almost 2 years and then decided to work as Tier 2 Technical Support for another company assisting Telco customers from the US. Currently, I am working home-based as installation support for an integration tool. Helping customers to integrate their records in their ERP and CRM systems, managing servers and sometimes databases. </p>
      <p>Aside from my hardware and software skills that are already in my profile, I think the most important of all as well is my personal skills. I am trained and well experienced to be customer service oriented. I am very flexible and can adapt easily to any changes required by the company may it be for the schedule or policies. Working home-based for more than 3 years proves that I can work with minimum supervision. Also, I love to analyze and organize. In fact, I created a Google Site for our team to compile all the JobAids, Notes and such. It's free and it serves as a "one-stop-shop" for the team. </p>
      <p>Regarding Google Workspaces/G-suite administration, I am managing and organizing our team's files for years now (since 2019). I created our department's handbook through Google Docs including JobAids. I manage our tasks and project updates through Google Sheets. I used Google Forms for our team to easily input their meetings and recordings. This form is then connected to a Sheet that serves as a database so we can conveniently track it. I use Google Slides whenever we have the training and product presentation.  All these are embedded in the Google Site that I shared with them. This includes our team calendar, an image carousel that shows our team's photos and other activities to cheer them up, charts and so on.</p>
      <p>I am sincerely hoping to hear back from you soon. Thank you so much!</p>
